# Public Metrics

Public Metrics creates public facing APIs and dashboards for key metrics tracked in Salesforce with a declarative and easy to set up process.

TODO:
* Write Introduction/Getting Started
* See if the doDML DML can happen in `PublicMetrics` so that the service consumers don't have to do that weird-ness
* Write a selector for the controller and api endpoint to get results.
* support more than just rowcount
* testing
